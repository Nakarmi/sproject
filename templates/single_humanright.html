                        <p class="tagline">Dignity, Equality & Justice for All</p>
                        <p>
                            The National Human Rights Commission, established as an independent statutory body in 2000, has now been elevated to a powerful constitutional 
                            body with a commensurate mandate, competence and independence. The NHRCN was elevated to a constitutional body by the Article 131 of the Interim 
                            Constitution of Nepal, 2007 and by Article 248 of the present Constitution of Nepal (2015). NHRC Nepal has a separate sphere of responsibilities 
                            as mandated in the Constitution of Nepal. These responsibilities complement the normal machinery of the Supreme Court, Office of the Attorney 
                            General, and other existing judicial and quasi-judicial bodies of Nepal. NHRCN submits its annual report of its functioning to the President, and 
                            the President causes that report to be laid through the Prime Minister before the Federal Parliament. The NHRCN motto, <em>‘Human rights for all, 
                            at every household: basis of peace and development’</em> has set a new goal to take human rights consciousness in every household.

                        <p>
                            The NHRCN was created in response to 1991 UN-sponsored meeting of the representatives of national institutions held in Paris. The meeting laid 
                            down Paris Principles, a detailed set of principles on the status of national institutions. These principles, subsequently endorsed by the UN 
                            Commission on Human Rights (Resolution 1992/54 of 3 March 1992) and the UN General Assembly (Resolution 48/134 of 20 December 1993) have become 
                            the foundation and reference point for the establishment and operation of the National Human Rights Commission of Nepal as well. The Commission 
                            is fully compliant with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (Paris 
                            Principles) and has been accredited with “A” status by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions. This status of the Commission 
                            and an embodiment of Nepal's concern for the promotion, protection and respect of human rights paved way to Nepal to be elected as a member of 
                            United Nations Human Rights Council.

                        <p>
                            The Paris Principle stresses that the composition of the national institution and the appointment of its members, whether by means of an election 
                            or otherwise, shall be established in accordance with a procedure which affords all necessary guarantees to ensure the pluralist representation of 
                            the social forces (of civilian society) involved in the promotion and protection of human rights.

                            Article 248 and 292 of Constitution of Nepal Provides that members of the Constitutional Bodies (including the NHRCN) are appointed on the 
                            recommendation of the Constitutional Council pursuant to Parliamentary hearing conducted for their appointments.

                            The Constitution has laid down the high qualifications that the members are required to have, to be eligible to be appointed to the Commission. Article 
                            248 of the Constitution of Nepal, has provisioned the following:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The Commission is mandated to ensure the respect, promotion and protection of human rights, is competent to launch inquiries and investigations into alleged 
                            human rights violations, and can recommend legal or departmental action against human rights violators. The establishment of the Commission complies with the 
                            standards set out in the Paris Principles. To name a few, independence is guaranteed by the Constitution and an act; a broad mandate based on 
                            universal human rights standards. Apart from these powers, the Constitution has also envisaged that the Commission may review the provisions on safeguards 
                            provided by the Constitution and other prevailing law for the enforcement of human rights and submit necessary recommendations for the effective implementation 
                            of such provisions.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>
                            The Commission propagates human rights education at different levels of society through various seminars, symposia, conferences and also builds consciousness and 
                            awareness for the protection of human rights. The Commission encourages the functioning and efforts of institutions working in the non-governmental sector. In 
                            addition, there is a general power to carry out such activities, as the Commission may deem necessary and appropriate for the enforcement, promotion and protection 
                            of human rights.
                        </p>
                        <p>&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>
                            The Commission has a broad mandate including civil and political rights, economic, social and cultural rights, and rights of the other groups. Article 249 of the 
                            Constitution of Nepal, 2015 lays down that the Commission shall perform the following functions, namely:
                        </p>
                        <ol id="ol">
